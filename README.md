# data structures

this is the stuff we did in data strucutres.  here's a list of every assignment:

1. **arraylist:** basically we made an arraylist and added different things to it using iteration and recursion, and had to write the big O notation of each method
2. **stack and queue:** this is actually qstack and squeue, where we implemented each one using the other.  we also had to make a linked list so that we could access the nodes and data.
3. **binary search tree:** this is not an AVL tree, don't be fooled.  classic recurssion stuff over here, adding and deleting nodes (but not balancing it).
4. **hashtable:** this one was so fun to make!!  it's a hashtable with separate chaining, and there's a load factor of course.  there's also a word count component of it.
5. **sorting:** writing insertion, bubble, merge, quick, shell, and "upgraded quicksort" which is a mix of quick and merge.  probaably the most difficult assignment.  
6. **graph:** unweighted undirected graph with dijikstra's algorithm, breadth first search, and depth first search.  there's also a weighted graph that i did for extra credit.
