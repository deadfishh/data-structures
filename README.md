# data structures

this is the stuff we did in data strucutres.  here's a list of every assignment:

1. ::arraylist:: basically we made an arraylist and added different things to it using iteration and recursion, and had to write the big O notation
2. __**stack and queue**__: this is actually qstack and squeue, where we implemented each one using the other.  we also had to make a linked list for whatever reason idk why.
3. binary search tree: this is not an AVL tree, don't be fooled.  classic recurssion stuff over here.
4. hashtable: this one was so fun to make!!  it's a hashtable with separate chaining, and there's a load factor ofc.  there's also some word count component of it.
5. sorting: oh my god i hate sorting so much.  everything here works but just barely.
6. graph: unweighted undirected graph with dijikstra's algorithm, breadth first search, and depth first search.  apparently the alphabetical component "doesn't work".  i turned in a badly done weighted graph for partial extra credit, maybe i'll come back and fix it at some point.
